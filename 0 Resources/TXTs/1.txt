            What is Computer Graphics?
       • In a broad sense is the use of a computer to create and manipulate 
         images 
         • It involves a combination of hardware (input, processing, output) 
           and software 
         • It can be 2D or 3D 
         • It is used in most electronic devices

                    Two major approaches

                                          Per-pixel
                                                         • Easy to parallelize but hard to map 
                                                            to hardware 
                                                         • Expensive! 
                                                         • It can be extended to model many 
                                                            physical phenomena such as 
                                                            internal scattering, diffraction, 
                                                            reflections, etc. 
                                                         • Used to obtain high quality images

                                Per-object
                                               • Easy to map to hardware 
                                               • While it cannot model directly 
                                                 complex effects, we can 
                                                 approximate them 
                                               • Used in interactive 
                                                 applications (mostly)

                               Course Goals
       • Study the fundamental mathematical concepts used in image 
          synthesis algorithms 
       • Implement a rendering system based on ray tracing 
       • Implement a rendering system based on object-order rendering 
          (rasterization)

                                  Prerequisites
        • Linear Algebra 
        • We will quickly review the concepts that you need, 
          if you are not familiar with basis, points, vectors, matrices and linear systems, 
          please review it on the textbook (Chapter 2, 5) 
        • C++  
          • We will review the basic concepts of C++, comparing them with Java. Keep 
             this reference at hand http://www.cppreference.com 
          • Why C++?

                                   Lectures
       • I will upload the slides on the website before the class, so that you 
         can directly annotate them 
       • For every class, I will always add references in the end to the 
         textbook and/or external resources 
       • At the end of every lecture, I will quickly introduce the topic of the 
         next lecture and give you pointers — you are encouraged to take a 
         look at the material before I present it in class
