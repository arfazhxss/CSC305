                             Bump Mapping
                 Instead of encoding colors in a texture, you encode normals!

                             Texture Mapping
        • The idea is the same. Instead of encoding values at vertices of triangles, you 
          encode them in images. 
        • You gain all the advantages of images (easy to store, compress, interpolate, sample) 
        • You can encode any property that you want, the most common are: 
          • Colors (Texture Mapping) 
          • Normals (Bump Mapping) 
          • Displacements (Displacement Mapping)
 CSC 305 - Introduction to Computer Graphics - Teseo Schneider
                    What do you need?
      • One additional per-vertex property, the UV coordinates 
      • An image uploaded to the GPU memory (2D texture) 
      • The UV coordinates are interpolated inside each triangle, and used to find the corresponding value 
        in the texture 
      • The texture value is interpolated before it is used in the shader

             “Seams” are needed for complex objects
                                                                           Image from Vallet and Levy, techreport INRIA

           How are UV maps encoded?
      • 2 versions of the mesh are stored, one for the triangles in 3D and one for those in 2D 
      • The faces of the 2 meshes are in one-to-one correspondence 
      • OpenGL does not support this you need to duplicate all the vertices on the seams and pass one 
       single mesh. An easy (and inefficient) way to do this is by duplicating all vertices and not using an 
       element buffer.

 CSC 305 - Introduction to Computer Graphics - Teseo Schneider
                                Mipmapping
      • Moire pattern can appear if 
        the resolution of the texture 
        is much higher than the 
        sampling rate 
      • A good solution for this 
        problem is mipmapping
